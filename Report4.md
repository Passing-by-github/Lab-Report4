# Lab Report 4

In this lab, we learned some command shortcuts and how to use vim. To showcase our new found understanding of vim, we'll use what we learned on ieng6 with a forked lab7 Repository.

Before starting, I must mention that these steps are done a new terminal, so there is no search history.  

**Step 1.** Log into ieng6:    
*Keys pressed:* `ssh cs15lfa23ku@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu`. `<enter>`, then I type my password `<enter>`. And that's how we enter into ieng6:

**Step 2.** Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL):   
**Step 3.** Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail:   
**Step 4.** Edit the code file to fix the failing test:    
**Step 5.** Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed:   
**Step 6.** Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!):
